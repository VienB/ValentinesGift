Missing you just makes me realize how much you mean to me. Our journey together has been a beautiful lesson in patience, trust, and the meaning of true commitment. I want you to know that I will always be by your side, regardless of anything happening around us. My feelings for you are unwavering; I never tire of your presence. Even in our moments apart, please know that you're always on my mind and forever in my heart. I love you! <3</div>
